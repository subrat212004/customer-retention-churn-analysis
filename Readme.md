# 📉 Customer Retention and Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior for a subscription-based business. The goal is to uncover insights that can help reduce churn and improve customer retention through data-driven strategies.

---

## 📌 Objective

To understand customer retention patterns, segment churned users, and identify key factors contributing to churn using **Python (Pandas)** and **SQL**, with visualizations planned in **Tableau**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- MySQL
- Tableau *(Dashboard in progress)*
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Retention Rate Calculation (weekly/monthly)
- Cohort Analysis and Retention Curves
- Customer Segmentation by Plan Type, Tenure, and Engagement
- Lifetime Value (LTV) Estimation
- SQL queries for validating churn metrics

---

## 🔍 Insights & Highlights

- High churn observed within the first 2 months for premium plan users.
- Long-tenure customers showed significantly higher retention and LTV.
- Identified low-engagement patterns leading up to churn events.
- Suggested targeted re-engagement for at-risk premium users.
